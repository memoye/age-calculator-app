## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form ✔️
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted ✔️
  - The day number is not between 1-31 ✔️
  - The month number is not between 1-12 ✔️
  - The date is in the future ✔️
  - The date is invalid, e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April) ✔️
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size ✔️
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page ✔️
- Bonus: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted ⭕
